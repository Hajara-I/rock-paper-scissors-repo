## Rock, Paper, Scissors game in React JS 

- A fully functional rock, paper, scissors app created in React JS 
- The game allows theuser to play against a 'computer' which responds to the user's selection by choosing between the three choices of 'rock', 'paper' or 'scissors'
- Although I have previosuly made a game similar to this using pure javascript, I wanted to take the opportunity to build it in React JS.
- The project primarily makes use of  the useState hook to manage the different states in the game like the user's choice, the computer's choice and the result's display
- The project also make use of the useEffect hook to manage the re-rendering of the app based on a number of dependencies. 
- Some aspects that proved challenging initially include the managing the state's between the user and the computer's choice and the if else loop which was rendering prematurely prior to incorporating the useEffect hook.
